## Coding Conventions

### Code Format

We know that indentation style is a personal matter but the codebase needs to look consistent, so please adhere to the conventions below.

*   Bracket style: largely Stroustrup (Egyptian braces), except for classes, functions and the like where we prefer to place the opening braces on a new line
*   4-space indentation, NO TAB CHARACTERS, no trailing spaces
*   Spaces around `=`, `==`, `&&`, `||`, and other operators.
*   No multi-line blanks within class/functions
*   Non-documentation comments: use `//` not `/**/`

The OMNeT++ IDE provides you pre-configured code styles in *Window -> Preferences -> C++ -> Code Style*. Choose *OMNeT++* as your code style. Pressing *Ctrl+Shift+F* will reformat your code to match this style.

### Naming Convention

Rules for variable names, function names, class names and other identifiers.

*   Use camel case
*   Variables and functions start with lower case
*   Types start with upper case
*   Constants and enum values are capitalized, with underscore as word separator
*   Don't abbreviate (too much)
*   Function names start with a verb
*   Functions returning a bool preferably start with `is` or `has`

### Commenting

*   Add copyright headers at the top of each source file. Use `//` comments for consistency with NED and MSG files.
*   Generally, use `//` comments in the code (except for Doxygen comments)
*   For documentation comments (Doxygen and NED), see [Documentation Guidelines][#documentation-guidelines]

### Class Layout

Consistent layout of class declarations throughout the project helps maintainers to remain sane.

*   Data members first, protected/private methods next, public methods last
*   Sort data members into *configuration* (or *parameters*), *state*, and *statistics* sections
*   Methods that are not public API should be private or protected
*   Use Doxygen comments (`/** */`) for public API only
*   Comment data members with `//` comments
*   Non-public methods can be left undocumented, or use `//` comments where necessary

### Functions

Misnamed and "kitchen-sink" functions are unfortunately quite common, and make the code hard to follow and reason about. Here's what you can do:

*   Functions should be focused (i.e. do one thing only), and the name should reflect the purpose
*   Try to minimize side effects (modify class members and other non-local state as little as possible)
*   If you cannot find an accurate name for it, it is a strong indicator that the function should not exist in that form (e.g. needs to be split up, or the code organized in a different way)
*   If it has a side effect, the name should reflect that (e.g. *get* methods must not modify state)
*   Local variables should be declared close to their use, in the smallest scope possible (i.e. not C-style, at the top of the function)
*   Commenting: we prefer breaking up the function body into logical blocks, and adding a `//` comment above each block to document its intended *purpose*

### C++ Style

Most users of INET are not C++ scholars. We think the codebase should be written in a style and in a subset of C++ that makes it accessible to our users.

*   Emphasis on readability, i.e. refrain from clever tricks and relatively obscure C++ features
*   Use of the Boost library and other excessively templated code is not allowed

### C++11 Features

From INET 3.0, the following [C++11 features][2] will be allowed (and recommended):

*   Non-static member initializers (preferred to constructors)
*   `auto` for iterators
*   `nullptr`
*   `static_assert`
*   Range-based `for` loops
*   `final` method keyword
*   `override` method keyword
*   Delegating constructors

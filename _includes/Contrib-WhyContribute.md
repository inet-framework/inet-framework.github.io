## Why Contribute

INET is a community project, and its progress largely depends on code contributions from community members. So it is good for the INET project if you contribute, but why is it good for you?

## You Benefit From It

If you are doing research with INET, contributing your changes back to the project means:

*   More visibility for your work
*   More testing and validation performed by other users
*   Other users may further improve or build upon your model
*   Burden of technical maintenance is on the INET core team

If you are a student doing homework or thesis with INET:

*   Expert feedback adds to your expertise and the quality of the end result
*   Your work will end up being useful for others (instead of landing in the drawer)
*   It expands your open source portfolio and demonstrates your expertise
*   Satisfaction from contributing to an open-source project

## Fun Project, Fantastic People

You might enjoy contributing, because:

*   Simulation can be fun in itself
*   The forum is full of helpful people
*   You can meet fellow INET people and other OMNeT++ users at the [OMNeT++ Summit][1]! (To get the atmosphere of the event, here's a photo album of the [2014 summit][2].)

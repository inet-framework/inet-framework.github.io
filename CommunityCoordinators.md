<p class="lead">Help us build a stronger community around INET.</p>

We are looking for organizers and/or publicity people to help us improve the INET Framework as an open-source project and community.
We see two general directions:

## Improve Publicity

We'd like to have more, more up to date, and higher quality information to be available about the INET Framework.

*   keep the INET web site up to date with new information
*   regularly collect progress information from INET developers/contributors, and disseminate it over various channels (mailing list, twitter, etc.)
*   collect and organize teaching materials
*   collect third-party tutorials, demos, related projects

## Harness the Potential of the Community

We see a great potential in the user community of the INET Framework. We have several people in the community with extensive knowledge on specific areas of computer networks, and there are many who are willing to contribute to INET as an open-source project. We'd like to achieve that people who have the knowledge and willingness to contribute to INET have an easier job to find ways to connect.

*   find [experts](ComponentExperts.html) for various INET components
*   collect feedback on issues and priorities of the user community
*   look for potential contributions (third-party projects, papers with INET-based simulations, etc.)
*   collect and advertise masters thesis topics that could result in contributions
*   work out and operate a bounty system

Tools: email, web, social media

If you are interested in any of these topics, please contact us.

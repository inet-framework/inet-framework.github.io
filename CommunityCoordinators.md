<p class="lead">Help us build a stronger community around INET.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p>We are looking for organizers and/or publicity people to help us
improve the INET Framework as an open-source project and community.
Please contact us if you are interested.</p>
</div>

We see two general directions:

## Improve Publicity

We'd like to have more, more up-to-date, and higher quality information available about the INET Framework.

*   Keep the INET website up-to-date with new information
*   Regularly collect progress information from INET developers/contributors and disseminate it over various channels (mailing list, Twitter, etc.)
*   Collect and organize teaching materials
*   Collect third-party tutorials, demos, and related projects

## Harness the Potential of the Community

We see great potential in the user community of the INET Framework. We have several people in the community with extensive knowledge in specific areas of computer networks, and there are many who are willing to contribute to INET as an open-source project. We'd like to make it easier for people with knowledge and willingness to contribute to INET to find ways to connect.

*   Find [advisors](ComponentAdvisors.html) for various INET components
*   Collect feedback on issues and priorities of the user community
*   Look for potential contributions (third-party projects, papers with INET-based simulations, etc.)
*   Collect and advertise master's thesis topics that could result in contributions
*   Work out and operate a bounty system

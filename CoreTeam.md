The INET Framework is maintained for the community by a small team of OMNeT++
developers, relying on contributions from the community.

Note: The core team very rarely implements new protocols or protocol features
from scratch. We usually concentrate on the INET architecture and on technical
(code quality) issues. We also work with contributors to help them write high
quality models.

You can reach us at \<nick\>@omnetpp.org.

<p><b>Note:</b> The core team concentrates its efforts on keeping the architecture solid and capable,
and the software quality high. Due to our limited resources, we rarely implement
new protocols or protocol features from scratch, so feature development is mostly up 
to the community. We also work with contributors to help them write high
quality models.</p>

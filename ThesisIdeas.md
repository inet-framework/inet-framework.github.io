title: Ideas for Master Theses

Several INET components have been originally developed as part of a Masters thesis at some university, for example the OSPFv2 model (at [TU Budapest][5]), IPv6 (at [Monash University][6]), or MPLS/LDP/RSVP-TE (capstone project at [TU Sydney][7]). We think that although the knowledge and programming skills of students vary greatly, a Masters project, if managed well and done by a competent student, has the potential to result in valuable contributions to INET.

On this page we'd like to give ideas to professors and students alike for INET-related thesis topics:

*   Implement new TCP congestion control algorithms, e.g. Vegas, Cubic, Westwood or others
*   Expand on SimuLTE, e.g. add control plane protocols and functionality
*   Expand MPLS support in INET, e.g. with control plane functionality
*   Implement the Bluetooth lower layers
*   Implement the H.323 and SIP protocols
*   Implement new ad-hoc routing protocols
*   Implement new group mobility models
*   <your idea here, please email us>

title: Ideas for Master Theses

Several INET components have originally been developed as part of a Master's
thesis at some university, for example the OSPFv2 model (at [TU Budapest][1]),
IPv6 (at [Monash University][2]), or MPLS/LDP/RSVP-TE (capstone project at
[TU Sydney][3]). Experience shows that a Master's project, if managed well and
done by a competent student, has the potential to result in valuable
contributions to INET.

On this page, we would like to provide ideas to professors and students alike for INET-related thesis topics:

* Implement new TCP algorithms, such as Cubic, Veno, Hybla, Illinois, Hamilton, Highspeed, or others
* Expand the LTE model (SimuLTE), e.g., add control plane protocols and functionality
* Expand MPLS support in INET, e.g., with control plane functionality
* Implement the Bluetooth lower layers
* Implement the H.323 and SIP protocols
* Implement new ad-hoc routing protocols
* Implement new group mobility models
* Add more realistic battery models
* ...

Additional topic suggestions are welcome. Contact us, and we'll add them to the list.

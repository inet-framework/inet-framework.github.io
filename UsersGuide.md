The User's Guide is currently in preparation. It provides an overview of the concepts, architecture, and main
components of the INET Framework, and it is meant to be used with the Reference.

You can read the current version of the User's Guide [here][4].

Helping hands on the INET documentation would be very much appreciated. More info [here][3].

Here are some things you can do after having installed INET successfully.

### Try Some Example Simulations

Find the `inet` project in the IDE workspace and explore it.
The sources of protocol implementations and other components are in the `src/` folder.
The `examples/` folder contains several example simulation models, that is,
networks assembled from components under `src/`.

You can launch an example simulation by selecting its folder and clicking *Run*
on the toolbar. The simulation will execute as a GUI application, letting you
explore, run, pause, and single-step the simulation model. The simulation results
will be placed into the `results/` subfolder; you can view them by
double-clicking the created `vec` or `sca` files.

### Familiarize Yourself With OMNeT++

You'll need OMNeT++ knowledge to create simulations with INET. The following
pages, each about 5-10 minutes to read, are automatically opened in the IDE
when you first start it. You can also access them later from the *Help* menu
(*Help Contents -> OMNeT++ Documentation -> Getting Started*).

* **OMNeT++ at a Glance**: explains the purpose of various files: `ini`, `ned`, `msg`, and so on.

* **Getting Started with the Simulation IDE**: an illustrated guide to performing basic tasks in the IDE.

Then, we strongly recommend that you go through the basic tutorial that comes with OMNeT++.
It will take more than a few minutes, but it's the quickest way to get you going.

* **Tictoc tutorial**: It consists of steps that start from a very simple simulation model
  and progressively makes it more complex, introducing you to new functionality along the way.

### Follow the INET Tutorials

Follow the tutorials that come with the INET Framework. 

* [INET Tutorials](https://inet.omnetpp.org/docs/tutorials)

Study the showcases that highlight how to use specific features in INET.

* [INET Showcases](https://inet.omnetpp.org/docs/showcases)

### Modify Simulations or Create New Ones

Armed with knowledge gained from experience in the previous steps, you should be
able to modify the example simulations or create simple new ones.

### Learn More

For more in-depth knowledge, e.g., to be able to understand and modify
the components INET provides, you need to study the documentation.

* [OMNeT++ User Manual](https://omnetpp.org/doc/omnetpp/manual)
* [INET User's Guide](https://inet.omnetpp.org/docs/users-guide/)
* [INET Developers's Guide](https://inet.omnetpp.org/docs/developers-guide/)
* [INET Reference](https://omnetpp.org/doc/inet/api-current/neddoc/)

### Asking for Help

When you are stuck, you can ask for help on the
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/omnetpp" target="_blank">OMNeT++ mailing list</a>.
Doing your research before posting and being specific will greatly increase
the chance that you'll receive a useful answer.

title: INET-4.3.3 and INET 4.2.6 Released
category: news
---

These maintenance releases contain compatibility fixes for OMNeT++ 6.0 Preview 12 and OMNeT++ 5.7 Preview 1 or later.

We are releasing these versions in the hope that they will ease the work of migrating your project to OMNeT++ 6.0. Here is an OMNeT++ compatibility list for various INET versions:

- INET 3.7.x: OMNeT++ 5.3 - 5.6.2
- INET 3.8.x: OMNeT++ 5.7.x (pre1 or later), 6.x (pre12 or later)
- INET 4.2.5: OMNeT++ 5.4.1 - 5.6.2
- INET 4.2.6: OMNeT++ 5.7.x (pre1 or later)
- INET 4.3.3: OMNeT++ 6.x (pre12 or later)

If you have a project that uses OMNeT++ 5.x and INET 3.x we recommend to migrate in several smaller steps (at least internally):

1. Migrate to OMNeT++ 5.7 and INET 3.8
2. Migrate to OMNeT++ 6.0 and then to INET 4.3

or alternatively:
1. Migrate to OMNeT++ 5.7 and INET 3.8
2. Migrate to INET 4.2.6 and then to OMNeT++ 6.0 and INET 4.3

Now that INET-1.99.4 has been released, we are currently concentrating on code and protocol reviews. 
Additional short term plans:

*   Implement DiffServ.
*   Merge/integrate the MiXiM project with INET.
*   Implement Node failure/recovery support.
*   Implement IPv6NetworkConfigurator (should work like the current IPv4NetworkConfigurator).

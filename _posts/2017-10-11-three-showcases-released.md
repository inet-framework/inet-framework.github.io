title: Three More Showcase Examples
category: news
---

We are happy to announce three new showcase examples for INET.
*Path Loss Models* demonstrates the use of various path loss models for
simulating radio propagation in INET, from simple ones like free space path loss
to more complex ones like Rician and Rayleigh fading.
*Power Consumption* demonstrates the modeling of energy consumption, energy
storage and generation in INET through the example of a mobile ad-hoc
network. *Visualizing Transport Connections* shows how to make INET add markers to
the endpoints of transport connections to help visually matching them.

To see which showcase examples and tutorials are available, choose the
*Showcases* and *Tutorials* items from the INET site menu.

If you spot errors or have other feedback, you can enter your comments
by following the "Discussion" links found in the showcases pages themselves.
If you wish to contribute, you can do so by submitting pull requests
against the `inet-showcases` repository.

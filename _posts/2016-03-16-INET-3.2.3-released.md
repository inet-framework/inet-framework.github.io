This is a minor maintenance release that requires either OMNeT++ 4.6, 
or 5.0rc or later. (Earlier test versions of OMNeT++ will not work.)

  - build: updated inet_featuretool (the same like the opp_featuretool in OMNeT++ 5.0 rc)
  - several fixes to make it compatible with both OMNeT++ 4.6 and 5.0
  - smoke and fingerprint tests are running on both OMNeT++ 4.6 and 5.0
  - some variable renames and fixes in ieee802.11

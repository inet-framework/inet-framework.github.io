In real life, many wireless devices have multiple radios so that
they can communicate on multiple wireless networks simultaneously.
Examples of such devices are mobile phones that have cellular, WiFi
and Bluetooth interfaces, or a dual-band wireless router. This
showcase demonstrates how such devices can be simulated in INET.

We are happy to announce the first showcase examples and tutorials for the
INET Framework. We have been internally working on these items for over
a year.

Showcases are elaborate example simulations or simulation studies
that show off various components and features of the INET Framework.
Each showcase consists of a fully configured simulation model that
has an associated documentation that describes the goal of the simulation
study and the simulation setup, and discusses the results.

To see what showcases and tutorials are available, choose the
**Showcases** and **Tutorials** items from the INET site menu.
We currently have 10 Visualization showcases and 5 Wireless
showcases. The Wireless Tutorial, which has been available for
some time, has also been updated.

We use the GitHub Pages infrastructure for the showcase and tutorial
web pages, which means that pages are easy to write (Markdown) and easy to contribute to (via GitHub pull requests).

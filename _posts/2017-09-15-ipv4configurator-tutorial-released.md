title: IPv4 Network Configurator Tutorial Released
category: news

How to configure IPv4 addresses and routing tables in an INET simulation
is a recurring question on the mailing list. It is not always trivial
how to use INET's network configurator for various types of networks,
and how to incorporate special requirements. Therefore, we are particularly happy
to report that we have completed the writing of the
*IPv4 Network Configurator Tutorial*, and it has been made available
on the INET site. We hope that the tutorial will be useful, and help
users get the most out of INET.

If you spot errors in the tutorial or have other feedback, you can
enter your comments by following the "Discussion" links found in the
tutorial pages themselves. If you wish to contribute, you can do so
by submitting pull requests against the `inet-tutorials` repository.

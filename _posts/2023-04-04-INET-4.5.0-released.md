title: INET-4.5.0 Released
category: news
---

This is a new minor stable release within the INET 4.x branch. The main feature of this release is the ability to concurrently run multiple simulations within the same process (requires OMNeT++ 7.0 preview 2 or later), along with an extended Ethernet cut-through switching functionality.

There are also a number of small improvements and several bug fixes. Some changes are backward incompatible, so existing models may need to be updated. This version requires OMNeT++ 6.0 or later.

For a complete list of all added, removed, and changed folders, NED modules, packet chunks, packet tags, statistics, C++ classes, and signals, please refer to the ChangeLog file in the src folder.

Service Announcement: We have renamed the *inetframework-devel@googlegroups.com*
mailing list to *inetframework-contrib@googlegroups.com*, to better reflect the
purpose of the list as a discussion forum for those who contribute to INET. If
you are already subscribed, you don't need to do anything, except for maybe
updating your mail filter rules. The mailing list continues to be available
at the updated web address <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/inetframework-contrib>.

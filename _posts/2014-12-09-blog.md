We are working in the *integration* branch towards INET-3.0.

What we've been doing since the INET-2.99.0 pre-release:

*   Set up a Coverity account for detecting defects via static code analysis
*   Introducing C++11 features in the code (nullptr, auto, in-class member initializers)
*   Working on the manual
*   Merged the PIM/IGMPv3 topic branch into integration

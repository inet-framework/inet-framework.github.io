title: Modeling Directional Antennas Showcase Released
category: news
---

This showcase aims to highlight the antenna models available in INET.
The showcase contains an example simulation which demonstrates the
directionality of five antenna models. Four of these represent well
known antenna models, while the last one is a universal antenna
which can model any rotationally symmetrical antenna pattern.

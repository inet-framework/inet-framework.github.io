title: INET-4.4.0 Released
category: news
---
This is a new minor stable release of the INET 4.x branch. The highlight of this release is the implementation of several Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) features. Also, INET is now fully licensed under LGPL.

Experimental Python support has been added for running simulations concurrently and optionally on an SSH cluster. This is mostly useful for running parameter studies, automated testing and optimizing parameters.

There are also a number of small improvements, and several bug fixes. Some changes are backward incompatible, so existing models may need to be updated. This version requires OMNeT++ 6.0 or later.

For a complete list of all added, removed, and changed folders, NED modules, packet chunks, packet tags, statistics, C++ classes, and signals please refer to the ChangeLog file in the src folder.

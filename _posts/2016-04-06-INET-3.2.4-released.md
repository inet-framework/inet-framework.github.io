title: INET-3.2.4 Stable Release Available
category: news

This is a minor maintenance release that requires either OMNeT++ 4.6,
or 5.0. (Earlier test versions of OMNeT++ will not work.)

  - build: updated inet_featuretool (the same as the opp_featuretool in OMNeT++ 5.0)
  - minor fixes to make it build under both OMNeT++ 4.6 and 5.0

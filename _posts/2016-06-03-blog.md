title: Heading towards INET 4.0
category: progress

With the release of INET 3.3, we are starting to work towards INET 4.0, which will contain numerous improvements that will require OMNeT++ 5.0. INET 3.3 is the last release that will work with both OMNeT++ 4.6 and 5.0. 

Major features to be added in INET 4.0:

- A rewritten wireless tutorial
- Enhanced visualization (2D/3D)
- Reorganized StandardHost internals that will enable better configurability
- Enhanced IEEE 802.11 MAC

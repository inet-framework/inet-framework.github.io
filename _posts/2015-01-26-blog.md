We added a bit/symbol-level physical layer model for the IEEE 802.11 OFDM PHY,
and a generic APSK model for experimentation. The implementation includes
forward error correction, scambling, interleaving and modulation. 
We have also started to run simulations to compare the symbol-level models
with frame-level simulations for model verification.

We have fixed more than 300 defects found by Coverity, decreasing Defect Density to 0.5/kLoC.

We plan to release 2.99.1 in the next few weeks.

In complex simulations, there are usually several statistics that are
vital for understanding what is happening inside the network. Although
statistics can also be found and read in Qtenvâ€™s object inspector panel,
it is often more convenient to directly display them on the top-level
canvas in a graphical form. INET supports such visualization in the
form of inspector figures that display various gauges and meters.

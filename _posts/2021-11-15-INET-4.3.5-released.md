These maintenance releases contain compatibility fixes for OMNeT++ 6.0 Preview 14 and OMNeT++ 5.7.

We are releasing these versions along with OMNeT++ 5.7 and OMNeT++ 6.0pre14 to help migrate your project to OMNeT++ 6.0. Here is an OMNeT++ compatibility list for various INET versions:

- INET 3.7.x: OMNeT++ 5.3 - 5.6.2
- INET 3.8.1: OMNeT++ 5.7.0, 6.0pre14
- INET 4.2.5: OMNeT++ 5.4.1 - 5.6.2
- INET 4.2.8: OMNeT++ 5.7.0, 6.0pre14
- INET 4.3.3: OMNeT++ 6.0pre12
- INET 4.3.4: OMNeT++ 6.0pre13
- INET 4.3.5: OMNeT++ 6.0pre14

If you have a project that uses OMNeT++ 5.x and INET 3.x, we recommend migrating in several smaller steps (at least internally):

1. Migrate to OMNeT++ 5.7
2. Migrate to INET 3.8
3. Migrate to OMNeT++ 6.0
4. Migrate to INET 4.2
5. Finally, migrate to INET 4.3

(Steps 3 and 4 can be done in reverse order too).

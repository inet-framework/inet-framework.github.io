title: Visualizing Radio Medium Activity Showcase Released
category: news

INET contains support for visualizing radio signals as they
propagate through space, making it easy to see which nodes
are transmitting and which are receiving at any given time,
and what signals are present at various nodes.

This showcase contains three configurations of increasing
complexity, each showing different features of the visualization.

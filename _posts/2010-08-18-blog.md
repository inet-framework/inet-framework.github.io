The following topic branches are currently open in the INET repository:

*   `topic/bgpv4` -- recently contributed BGP protocol (mostly done)
*   `topic/ethernet` -- changing Ethernet to use channel datarate instead of parameter (mostly done)
*   `topic/ospfrenaming` -- OSPF model code style fixes (mostly done)
*   `topic/signals` -- signals-based result recording instead of cOutVector/recordScalar (halfway)
*   `topic/PcapTrace` -- capturing and recording PCAP traces via GUI
*   `topic/tcp_lwip` -- lwIP integration as alternative TCP (mostly done)
*   `topic/tcp_socket_read` -- application-level flow control in TCP (in work)
*   `topic/tcptransfermode` -- refactoring of TCP send/recvQueueClass to a transferMode parameter (halfway)
*   `topic/wizards` -- wizards to generate wireless and other networks (halfway)

The plan is to have these branches finished, reviewed, and merged into master over the next few months.

title: INET-4.3.9, 4.2.10, and 3.8.3 Released
category: news
---

These maintenance releases contain compatibility fixes for OMNeT++ 6.0 and OMNeT++ 5.7.

Here is an OMNeT++ compatibility list for various INET versions:

- INET 3.7.x: OMNeT++ 5.3 - 5.6.2
- INET 3.8.3: OMNeT++ 5.7.0, 6.0
- INET 4.2.5: OMNeT++ 5.4.1 - 5.6.2
- INET 4.2.10: OMNeT++ 5.7.0, 6.0

If you have a project that uses OMNeT++ 5.x and INET 3.x, we recommend migrating in several smaller steps (at least internally):

1. Migrate to OMNeT++ 5.7
2. Migrate to INET 3.8
3. Migrate to OMNeT++ 6.0
4. Migrate to INET 4.2.10
5. Finally, migrate to INET 4.3.9 (or the master branch)

(step 3 and 4 can be done in reverse order, too)

title: INET-2.99.0 Development Release Available
category: Release
---

This release is a snapshot of the development that has begun in early 2013,
and will culminate in the release of INET-3.0. The code is work in
progress, which means all details may still change until 3.0 is reached.

The highlights of this release are:

*   Network layer refactoring that allows higher layer protocols (including
    routing protocols) to be written in a network protocol agnostic manner.

*   A new physical layer model that builds upon the INET and MiXiM physical
    layers, and brings them to new heights. Design goals were extreme
    modularity, extensibility, the ability to support (and easily switch
    between) various levels of detail, and the ability to add support for
    exploiting various pieces of parallel hardware.

*   Extensive refactoring aimed at improving code quality. It includes
    directory restructuring, code formatting, refactoring of init stages and
    publish-subscribe communication, and more.

This version requires OMNeT++ 4.6 or later. Read

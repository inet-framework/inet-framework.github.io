title: INET-3.2.0 Stable Release Available

For this release, we put a lot of work into refining and validating the new, extensible 802.11 MAC model to make it ready for replacing the old codebase. We used the ns-3 Wifi model for validation. This INET version, in addition to other improvements and bug fixes, also compiles with the recently released 3rd beta of OMNeT++ 5.0.

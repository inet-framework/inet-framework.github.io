title: MANET Routing Protocols Showcase Released
category: news
---

Most routing protocols for mobile adhoc networks (MANETs) can be categorized
as being either reactive or proactive. INET contains various routing protocols
for MANETs from both categories, and from other categories as well.

This showcase demonstrates the configuration and operation of three MANET routing
protocols with three example simulations, using a reactive (AODV), a proactive (DSDV),
and a location based (GPSR) routing protocol.

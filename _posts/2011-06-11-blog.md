For the last six months or so, development has taken place in the **master** branch of the repository, with periodic releases of that branch as INET-1.99.x.

To see what's been done, check the WHATSNEW file in the repository, or browse the commits directly.

Short-term plans include the integration of the 802.15.4 model from INETMANET, HttpTools and MiXiM.

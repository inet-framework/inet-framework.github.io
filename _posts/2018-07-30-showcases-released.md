title: MAC Protocols for Wireless Sensor Networks Showcase Released
category: news
---

There are media access control (MAC) protocols designed specifically
for wireless sensor networks. INET has several such protocol implementations,
alongside IEEE 802.15.4 models. This showcase consists of two parts. In Part 1,
we demonstrate three wireless sensor network MAC protocols with three example
simulations of a wireless sensor network. In Part 2, we compare the three
protocols using statistics.

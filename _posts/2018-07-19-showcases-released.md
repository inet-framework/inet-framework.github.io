title: PCAP Recording Showcase Released
category: news
---

INET has support for recording PCAP traces from simulations.
The recording process produces PCAP files that are similar to
real-world PCAP traces, so one can use the same tools and
techniques for analyzing simulated traffic as used on real
traffic, such as Wireshark and TCPDump. Knowledge of PCAP
can be reused in the context of simulations.

This showcase contains an example simulation that generates
and records PCAP traces of TCP, UDP, and ICMP traffic, using
various physical layer protocols like Ethernet and 802.11.

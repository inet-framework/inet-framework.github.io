title: INET 3.0 Released
category: progress
---

INET 3.0 is released after more than one and a half years of development.
We will soon merge the content of the 'integration' branch into 'master'.
The old 2.x codebase may receive only compatibility fixes on the 'v2.x' branch. 
The 'integration' branch will contain all the changes that are considered 
major and are scheduled for INET 4.0.

We hope that you find the changes in INET 3.0 useful and will start using it 
in your own projects.

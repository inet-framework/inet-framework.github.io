title: Git Changes After the INET 3.0 Release
category: progress
---

Now that INET 3.0 has been released, we made some changes to the git repository:

* The old `master` branch has been renamed to `v2.x`. It will hold maintenance commits
for the INET 2.x.
* The `master` branch has been set to the commit containing the 3.0 release.
* The `integration` branch will contain the changes scheduled for INET 4.0.

We hope that you find the changes in INET 3.0 useful and will start using it 
in your own projects.

This page describes what's planned for INET in the future.

## After INET 4.3 

1. mobility models
    * separate initial positioning from positioning over time
    * make them composable sequentially and additively
    * extend interface with future movement predictions

2. physical layer
    * support capturing a stronger signal while receiving a weaker one
    * support aborting an ongoing transmission
    * add the simulation of synchronization process (pilot/preamble)
    * add missing Weibull and Jakes fading
    * add multipath support
    * add real CUDA and multi-core parallel execution

3. IPv6
    * IPv6 has not yet been through the same refactoring and improvements as the IPv4 model
    * after that, xMIPv6 needs to be tested and revised as well

4. NeuralNet based Error model

5. Documentation
    * review new and modified NED module and C++ class comments

6. Examples
    * review existing examples
    * add new more meaningful, more specific feature examples (e.g. crosstalk)
    * reduce redundancy in inifiles (e.g. lots of unrelated configuration entries) that makes understanding examples more difficult than necessary
    * review directory structure (e.g. more different wireless directories), make the structure more similar to the source directory structure
    * extend the wireless tutorial with additional steps

7. Tests
    * some examples are rather tests, they were usually created during development for quick testing
    * we definitely need more (some?) validation tests (e.g. comparison with other simulators, real-world measurements, or analytical results)

As for the not-so-near future (potentially in a later major version), we are considering some nontrivial changes:

1. synchronous sends
    * introducing synchronous (immediate) message sends to reduce communication overhead between protocol layers

2. Factor out the base infrastructure from INET so we would have a subset of components that could be separately supported.
   Protocol-specific code should be avoided in this codebase.

3. Based on the common infrastructure create a framework where generic network models could be built using only the
   combination of exsisting (very simple) modules. This could be useful for modeling abstract network concepts.

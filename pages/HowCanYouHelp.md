You can help in several ways. Contributions can be as small as a bugfix or a documentation improvement, or as large as a new protocol implementation. 

As an student: 

*   Seek INET-related project and thesis topics 
*   Report and/or fix problems you encounter in the code and the documentation 
*   Participate in the forums and help others 

As a researcher: 

*   When you review/validate models to be used for your project (advised!), share your findings 
*   Contribute the models you write 

As a professor: 

*   Advertise INET-related [thesis topics][3], and encourage your students to share the resulting code or findings 
*   Use INET in teaching, and share the materials you use 

As an open-source enthusiast: 

If you think INET is cool and you are actively looking for ways to help the project, here are some tips: 

*   There are several murky corners in INET in need for a little love (cleanup, refactoring, fixes, features, testing, examples...) -- please email us 
*   You can help us with [community management][5] and publicity tasks 
*   Investigate open issues in the [bug tracker][6] 
*   Help us reduce the list of issues found by Coverity or Valgrind

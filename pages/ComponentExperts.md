The INET Framework contains the implementations of numerous protocols and concepts, and maintenance of the codebase and reviewing contributions often poses challenges that are difficult to meet with a small team of core developers. In this table we are collecting people who have specialized knowledge and expertise in certain areas, and are willing to help developers/maintainers by advising them.

# INET Framework Installation

INET requires [OMNeT++][1] to work. If you are new to OMNeT++, make yourself familiar with it first, otherwise you won't be able to use INET. At the very least, go through the TicToc Tutorial. 

After unpacking the INET tarball (`tar xvfz INET-<version>.tgz`), start the OMNeT++ IDE, import the project via File->Import->Existing Projects to the Workspace, and build with Ctrl+B. Then you should be able to launch example simulations. Please read the INSTALLATION file carefully before building.

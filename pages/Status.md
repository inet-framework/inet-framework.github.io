Supports classic Ethernet (10Mbps), Fast Ethernet (100Mbps), Gigabit Ethernet (1000Mbps). There are two MAC implementations: one with the full CSMA/CD protocol, and a simplified one without CSMA/CD that can be used for full-duplex links. Supports raw Ethernet, Ethernet-II and Ethernet SNAP frames. There is a hub and a switch model; the switch relay unit has several flavours which differ in the performance models. Ethernet MAC currently expects the data rate in a module parameter instead of the link `datarate` parameter; this is currently being changed (new code is available in an INET repo branch). |

We provide the following material for the INET Framework:

*   **[Available Protocols][1]**. The table lists the various protocol models and other components available in the INET Framework and extension projects.

*   **[INET Reference][2]**. The Reference is generated from NED and C++ sources of the last stable INET release.

*   **INET Framework Manual**. The manual (in preparation) will provide an overview of the concepts, architecture, and main components of the INET Framework. It is meant to be used with the Reference.

**Note:** The Manual is currently being prepared, and help would be very much appreciated. More info [here][3].

Other:

*   The [Tutorials][4] page is a collection of links to INET introductory material

*   The [Teaching Resources][5] page is a collection of links to presentation slides and other material useful for teaching

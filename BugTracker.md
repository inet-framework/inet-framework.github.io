The INET project uses the OMNeT++ Bug Tracker.

*   Bug tracker URL: [http://bugs.omnetpp.org][1]

**Note:** choose "INET Framework" in the "Project" combo in the top right corner on the bug tracker page if not automatically chosen.

To report a bug or suggest an enhancement, log in to the bug tracker, and click Report Issue. Create an account if you do not have one (anonymous bug reporting is not supported). Before submitting the bug report, please check that the problem was not reported before by someone else.

If you haven't submitted a bug report before, please read the following pages carefully:

*   [Bug Writing Guidelines][2]
*   [How to Report Bugs Effectively][3]

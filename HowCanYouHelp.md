You can help in several ways. Contributions can be as small as a bugfix or a documentation improvement, or as large as a new protocol implementation.

#### As a student:

*   Seek INET-related project and thesis topics
*   Report and/or fix problems you encounter in the code and the documentation
*   Participate in the forums and help others

#### As a researcher:

*   When you review/validate models to be used for your project (advised!), share your findings
*   Contribute your improvements and the models you write

#### As a professor:

*   Advertise INET-related project and thesis topics, and encourage your students to share the resulting code or findings
*   Use INET in teaching, and share the materials you use

#### As an open-source enthusiast:

If you think INET is cool and you are actively looking for ways to help the project, here are some tips:

*   Any item on the [Contribution Ideas](ContributionIdeas.html) page
*   There are several murky corners in INET in need for a little work to be invested (refactoring, features, testing, example simulations)
*   You can help us with [coordinating the community](CommunityCoordinators.html) and publicity tasks
*   Investigate and comment on open issues in the [bug tracker](BugTracker.html) (many reports are obsolete or unreproducible)
*   Help us reduce the list of issues found by Coverity or Valgrind
*   ...

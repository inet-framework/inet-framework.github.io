You can help in several ways. Contributions can be as small as a bugfix or a documentation improvement, or as large as a new protocol implementation.

As an student:

*   Seek INET-related project and thesis topics
*   Report and/or fix problems you encounter in the code and the documentation
*   Participate in the forums and help others

As a researcher:

*   When you review/validate models to be used for your project (advised!), share your findings
*   Contribute the models you write

As a professor:

*   Advertise INET-related [thesis topics][1], and encourage your students to share the resulting code or findings
*   Use INET in teaching, and share the materials you use

As an open-source enthusiast:

If you think INET is cool and you are actively looking for ways to help the project, here are some tips:

*   There are several murky corners in INET in need for a little love (cleanup, refactoring, fixes, features, testing, examples...) -- please email us
*   You can help us with [community management][2] and publicity tasks
*   Investigate open issues in the [bug tracker][3]
*   Help us reduce the list of issues found by Coverity or Valgrind
*   ...

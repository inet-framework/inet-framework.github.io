<p class="lead">You need a good simulation tool, and INET needs your help to improve.</p>

## What's In It For Me?

If you are doing research with INET, contributing your changes back to the project means:

*   More visibility for your work
*   More testing and validation performed by other users
*   Other users may further improve or build upon your model
*   Burden of technical maintenance is on the INET core team

If you are a student doing homework or thesis with INET:

*   Expert feedback adds to your expertise and the quality of the end result
*   Your work will end up being useful for others (instead of landing in the drawer)
*   It expands your open source portfolio and demonstrates your expertise
*   Satisfaction from contributing to an open-source project

## Fun Project, Fantastic People

You might enjoy contributing, because:

*   Simulation and hacking on models can be fun in itself
*   The forum is full of helpful people
*   You can meet fellow INET people and other OMNeT++ users at the [OMNeT++ Summit][1]! (To get the atmosphere of the event, here's a photo album of the [2014 summit][2].)
